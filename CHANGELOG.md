## [0.1.89] - 2026-05-29
- **Support for metadata alias for tokens in Anthropic instrumentation** - Capture various token alias for anthropic instrumentation
- **Support for streaming output on root spans** - Add utility for attaching streaming output to root spans

## [0.1.88] - 2026-05-20

- **Support for distributed tracing during sub-process invocation** - Auto instrument subprocess module to automatically set current context as traceparent in sub-process environment whenever a new sub-process is created. Update `Netra.init` to automatically activate context from traceparent if traceparent is found in current environment.

- **Add new utility `models` to fetch model pricing from Netra** - Add SDK utility `get_model_pricing` to fetch model details and their pricing from Netra

- **Add timestamp info of Time to First Token (TTFT) in LLM spans** - Add timestamp data of TTFT as a new attribute, `gen_ai.performance.time_to_first_token.timestamp`, in LLM spans from OpenAI, LiteLLM, Google GenAI, Cerebras, Claude Agent, Agno, ADK, and Groq

## [0.1.87] - 2026-05-20

- **Prioritize input and output attributes explicitly set by user over attributes from instrumentation.**
Users can be now overwrite the input and ouput attributes of spans created by instrumentations. The input and output values auto-captured by the instruments will be overwritten by values explicitly passed by users using the exposed utilities.
